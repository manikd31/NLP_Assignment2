### Using 1-Dimensional Convolution Neural Networks for the task of Sentiment Prediction

The given code saves a PyTorch model (best scenario in my case) to the given drive directory.

Pytorch models are evaluated using two different optimizers (Adam and RMSprop).

In addition to PyTorch, a classification model is also developed using keras for the same two optimizers and tested for accuracy.
